Spring boot project that implements a platform for cinemas to manage their movies. The users can create accounts, view their personal info, view the available cinemas, view the available
movies for each cinema and search them by name and director. The regular user can also reserve or buy a ticket for a specific movie. The admin can register cinemas into the system and add
movies for them.
The interface pages use html and thymeleaf in their implementation.
